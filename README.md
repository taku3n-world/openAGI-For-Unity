# OverView

Recently, I often see word, virtual human. The Modeling is very beautiful, and we become addicted to its breathtaking beauty.
But It does not work themselves. There is a person --even though we cannot see her-- in a virtual human.

So, we want to do is to create virtual human's emotion!
If you have ideas, please create pull request and commit file!

Everyone can use this, and everyone can create pull request.
Thank you!

# Our Goal

Our first goal is that stand alone girl can fight herself!
Did you think it is possible without emotion logic?
Yes, possible. Of course hard code or machine learning can create fight-girl either.
But It is important that she can decide to do anything herself by using EMOTIONAL-CORE.
Fight or escape, attack or defend or dodge, almost of all decision is decided through EMOTIONAL-CORE.
So, Our ultimate Goal is to complete EMOTIONAL-CORE!
